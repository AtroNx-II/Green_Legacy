SCEN1LINE6= "Your name is BYAKUREN. As was previously mentioned, and is\nas written in thousands of other adventures like this, it is\nyour BIRTHDAY. Or at least, what you assume it to be.";
SCEN1LINE7= "Your INTERESTS don't include much, really, as having\nINTERESTS leads to one being too materialistic, which you\nperceive as an incredibly BAD THING. Your room is almost\nempty save for hints of your LOVE FOR SCRIBING and studying\nPSYCHURGY.";
SCEN1LINE8= "Just like your late BROTHER, you are an aspiring MAGICIAN.\nFrom time to time, you also like to partake in COMPETITIVE\nACTIVITIES against people. Additionally, as a health nut,\nyou're actually incredibly fit and STRONG for your age.";

SCEN1LINE91= "Oh, that's right. You had recently switched out your fetch\nmodus for INVENTORRENT like everyone else when you all\ndecided to play this game. It's what you use as sort of like\nan inventory. Like in the video games.";
SCEN1LINE92= "Everything you captchalogue can be seeded and leeched by\neveryone you have in your file sharing group to erase the\nhassles of captcha codes in order to ensure a successful\ngroup effort.";
SCEN1LINE93= "This is also to make sure that nobody captchalogues\nanything harmful while working with others as all items\nare visible to everyone in the group.";
SCEN1LINE94= "Thankfully, it has a system that allows you to either set\ncaptchalogued items to public or private. Yours has been\nset to public by default as you totally have nothing to hide. ";
SCEN1LINE95= "However, the file sharing was rigged to not activate until\nboth team leaders approve. You and this other person have\nagreed not to activate it until everyone is playing the game.\nFor now, it works like a regular fetch modus. It's a pretty\nhandy fetch modus.";

SCEN1LINE18= "Well, that was nice of them. You're surprised they actually\nremembered your birthday, though. It seems like they're\nthe only one who sent you anything resembling a present.\nYou're not into material things, but it's a bit heartwarming.";
SCEN1LINE19= "You've never seen a real live tiger before in your life.\nThey've probably died off due to human cruelty or just\noverhunting in general. That's a shame, really.";
